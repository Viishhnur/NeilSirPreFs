/*
Vishal is a software engineer working on the development of a new text-based game. 
In the game, players are given a set of clues based on specific letters of the 
alphabet, and their task is to identify the "next" letter in the sequence. To 
enhance the game, Vishal wants to implement a feature where the next letter 
follows the cyclic order of the alphabet, meaning after "z", the next letter 
loops back to "a."

He has a list of sorted letters from 'a' to 'z' that represent available clues,
and his task is to find the next valid letter, or "successor," for a given clue. 

For example, if the clue is "f," and the sorted list of letters is "adghijl", 
the successor should be the smallest letter greater than "f," which is "g."

The letters are guaranteed to be sorted in non-decreasing order, and Vishal 
needs to solve this problem efficiently in logarithmic time.

Your task is to help Vishal by implementing the functionality to find the successor 
for a given letter in the sorted list of clues. If no valid successor is found, 
the answer should wrap around cyclically to the first letter in the list.

Input Format:
-------------
Line-1:A string str[]
Line-2: a character represents an alphabet.
 
Output Format:
--------------
Print a character which is the successor.
 
Constraints:
------------
2 <= str.length<= 10^4
'alp' is a lowercase letter.

 
Sample Input-1:
---------------
adghijl
f 
Sample Output-1:
----------------
g

Sample Input-2:
---------------
abcdefghi
j

Sample Output-2:
----------------
a
