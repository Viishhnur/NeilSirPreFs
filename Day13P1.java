/*
You have a list of employee objects representing the company's staff, 
with each object containing the following attributes:
    - name (String)
    - age (int)
    - department (String)
    - salary (double)

Write a Java program that reads the number of employees and their details 
from user input, where each employeeâ€™s data is entered on a single line 
in the format: name age department salary.

Your task is to perform the following operations Using the Streams API:
    - Filter the list to include only employees with a salary greater than 50,000.
    - Map the remaining employees to a new list of their names only.
    - Reduce the salaries of the remaining employees to calculate the 
      total salary expenditure for these employees.
    - Partition the list of employees into two groups: 
        - one with employees above 30 years of age.
        - another with employees 30 years or younger.

Implement each operation using the appropriate Java Streams methods.

Expected Outcome:
----------------
    - A filtered list of employee names whose salary is greater than 50,000.
    - The total salary expenditure of employees earning above 50,000.
    - Two partitioned groups of employees: 
        one with age > 30, and the other with age <= 30.
        
Sample Input:
-------------
6
Alice 25 IT 60000
Bob 35 Finance 45000
Charlie 28 IT 52000
David 40 HR 70000
Eve 30 Finance 49000
Frank 32 IT 80000

Sample Output:
--------------
Names of Employees with Salary > 50,000:
[Alice, Charlie, David, Frank]
Total Salary Expenditure for Employees with Salary > 50,000:
262000.0
Employees above 30 years of age:
[Employee{name='Bob', age=35, department='Finance', salary=45000.0}, Employee{name='David', age=40, department='HR', salary=70000.0}, Employee{name='Frank', age=32, department='IT', salary=80000.0}]
Employees 30 years or younger:
[Employee{name='Alice', age=25, department='IT', salary=60000.0}, Employee{name='Charlie', age=28, department='IT', salary=52000.0}, Employee{name='Eve', age=30, department='Finance', salary=49000.0}]
