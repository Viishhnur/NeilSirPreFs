Runnable and Callable both are functional interface
Runnable run method doesn't return anything
Callable call method has a return type , the return type which comes from a call is called Future object
call is async call , we can apply get method directly on Future object 

Can we cancel a promise or not?

Future object call can be cancelled

If we have 100 cores then there will be 200 threads.


In normal java , if we create multiple threads , each thread is not doing much , leads to Thread Explosion
Instead create a thread poll by
ExecutorService executor =  Executors.newFixedThreadPoll(3);
By this we can limit the number of threads


Callables produce Future obj , apply get method on it to retreive the result
